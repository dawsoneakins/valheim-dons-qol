# ADR 0001: BaseStorage keys are ignored by vanilla Valheim

## Status

Accepted

## Context

BaseStorage persists a small amount of data inside vanilla game data:

- `basestorage.cat`: the chest category (a category name, or Keep), in the chest's networked object data (ZDO).
- `basestorage.lock`: the organize lock record (holder id, holder name, expiry), in the ZDO of the lowest-id station in a base.
- `basestorage.fav`: the favourite inventory slots of versions before 0.4.1, in the player profile custom data. It is read once, converted and removed.
- `basestorage.favitems`: the favourite item types, in the player profile custom data.
- `basestorage.name`: a chest's name, stored on the chest and cleaned on every read.
- `basestorage.base`: a base's name, stored on every station of the base and cleaned on every read.
- `basestorage.seen`: the creatures and biomes a player has met, stored in the character's custom data for the spoiler-free compendium.
- `basestorage.journal`: the player's own compendium state in the character's custom data: hints shown, names revealed, hints tracked on screen, pages already read, and the spoiler settings. Damaged entries are skipped.
- `basestorage.feed`: what a station is kept fed with and how much to leave in the base, in the station's ZDO.
- `basestorage.collect`: what a cooking station does with cooked food (`off`, `chests` or `drop`), in the station's ZDO. Unset means to chests while the station is kept fed, and off otherwise.

Players must be able to remove the mod without damaging their world or characters.

## Decision

The mod stores nothing except values under these five keys, all prefixed `basestorage.`. Items always stay in vanilla inventories and containers; the mod never moves them into a private store. The keys are declared once, in `PersistenceKeys`, and each value is read and written only through its v1 codec (`CategoryCodec`, `OrganizeLockCodec`, `FavouritesCodec`, `FavouriteItems`, `FeedSelection`).

Vanilla Valheim ignores ZDO keys and profile custom-data keys it does not know, so these values are inert without the mod.

A malformed, truncated or foreign value decodes to no value (null) and never throws, so a hand-edited or old save cannot break loading.

## Consequences

- Uninstalling the mod leaves every chest and item intact. A leftover key changes no vanilla behaviour.
- Vanilla does not remove the leftover keys, so they stay in the world save and the profile after uninstall.
- Reinstalling the mod reads the leftover keys again through the v1 codecs.
- Adding a new key later is additive but must also be added to this ADR's key list.
- Changing a wire format needs a new format tag and a migration story; v1 decoders return no value for unknown tags.
